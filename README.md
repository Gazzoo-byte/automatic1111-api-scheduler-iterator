# automatic1111-api-scheduler-iterator

A kinda simple python script based on the example provided by Automatic1111 which iterates through all the provided schedulers and generates an image for each

Place in the same folder as webui.py and run it, the files will be output in the same folder and named according to which scheduler made it.
